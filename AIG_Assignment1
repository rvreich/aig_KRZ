Jika saya menjadi driver gojek, dan ingin dapat penumpang dari jam 7 pagi hari sabtu sampai jam 19.00. Kemana saya harus pergi ?
Berapa peluang saya mendapatkan penumpang jika mangkal disitu..

We believe that being a go-jek driver must utilize his/her knowledge to ensure optimum efficiency in making money for daily basis.
First part, set-up
Let’s build up the knowledge of the “our” driver. Because we are binusians, we set our territory as that around Binus,
in this case Palmerah. And because we live there, we have the knowledge of shortcuts,
locals’ habits (including but not limited to Binus’ students),

Second part, action.
Because it’s Saturday, and morning, the driver will stand-by around binus
because lots of students might be lazy enough to walk themselves to the campus.
So the most strategic place is around “U” Alley because lots of students board there.
